    Accepts a list of search keywords as arguments,
    queries the Flickr API for the top-rated image for each keyword,
    downloads the results,
    crops them rectangularly,
    assembles a collage grid from ten images and writes the result to a user-supplied filename.

    If given less than ten keywords, or if any keyword fails to
    result in a match, retrieve random words from a dictionary
    source such as `/usr/share/dict/words`. Repeat as necessary
    until you have gathered ten images.
